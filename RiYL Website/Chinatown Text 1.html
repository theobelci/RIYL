<p class="bodyp">At the same time, the sheer familiarity with Repin’s Barge Haulers among 
the present-day Chinese populace—decades after the Sino-Soviet split in 1960—illuminates a 
curious anachronism, both in history and historical awareness. Deeply entrenched as it is in 
collective cultural memory, Repin’s iconic painting has never been associated with ideological 
fervor nor recognized for its art-historical significance, finding appropriate analogy not in the 
Mona Lisa or Mao’s portraits, but in Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans, which reflects a potent 
saturation in vernacular culture and feelings. While the Sino-Soviet split, which endured until 1989, 
certainly meant an “official” rupture in the historical relations between the USSR and the PRC, 
the actual break was far from clean given that Soviet ideology, culture, and ways of life continued 
to shape Chinese nation-building and everyday life in many ways, some more recognizable than others. 
For example, English would not replace Russian as the official foreign language taught in schools 
until two decades after the initial split. Furthermore, art pedagogy institutionalized by Konstantin 
Maksimov (1913–94), a Stalin Prize winner who introduced the drawing techniques of Pavel Chistyakov 
(1832–1919) as the foundation for academic training at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing,
continues to inform the processes through which artists are selected and trained in the academy. 
The list goes on: Chinese socialist monuments, urban spaces, industrial structures, and vernacular 
remnants remain robustly indebted to Soviet culture. The Soviet model of “systematically promoting 
the national consciousness” of its ethnic minorities and engaging in diplomacy in the Global South 
echoes widely in state-management and nation-building endeavors in post-socialist states, shaping 
discourses around representation and identity in the visual and performance arts. Even Soviet jokes 
have reemerged as a genre of satire and political dissent in Chinese cyberspace; the most significant 
example is the recent “White Paper Revolution” (which references similar actions in Russia), where 
the precise understanding of censure and control produces collective meaning and resistance.</p>

<p class="bodyp">Thus, the perceived split between the USSR and China created sticky historiographical conditions. 
Today, post-socialist/communist studies—including theory on the increasingly popular subject of 
nostalgia—tend to limit their scope to former Soviet states and the Eastern bloc regions. Meanwhile, 
research on the Sino-Soviet relationship has traditionally focused on leaders, ideology, and 
geopolitics, leaving mostly untouched the emotional and cultural ties developed over multiple 
generations. This is noted by Elizabeth McGuire in her 2018 book Red at Heart: How Chinese 
Communists Fell in Love with The Russian Revolution:</p>
